Polonnaruwa is the ancient capital of Sri Lanka from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries and the repository of outstanding ruins, frescoes and enormous statues of reclining Buddhas. The ruins of the old city are on the shores of Lake Topawewa, man-made during the reign of a twelfth century king-a huge task, when one considers it was accomplished with nothing but manual labor. What remains of the ancient city itself is a cluster of palaces and temples contained within a rectangular city wall. The foundations of the royal palace and the king's audience hall are particularly well preserved.

Then visit Ambakka, Gadaladeniya and Lankathilake

The Ambakke Viharaya or the Embekke Devale is definitely counted as one of the temples, worth more than just a visit. The Ambakke Viharaya deserves more of exploring and admiring than just a quick glance through. Considered to be one of the finest examples of Buddhist temple architecture, the Gadaladeniya Viharaya is definitely one of the must-visits when you’re planning a trip to Kandy in Sri Lanka.

Murals, paintings, sculpture and architecture – the Lankathilaka Viharaya is definitely a sight to behold.</p>

Colombo is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life and colonial buildings and ruins and the population of about 752,993 in the city limits. It was formerly the political capital of Sri Lanka, before Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte. Due to its large harbor and its strategic position along the East-West sea trade routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago. It was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. Like many cities, Colombo's urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority, encompassing other Municipal and Urban Councils. The main city is home to a majority of Sri Lanka's corporate offices, restaurants and entertainment venues. Famous landmarks in Colombo include the Galle Face Green, the Viharamahadevi Park, Bandaranayake Memorable International Conference Hall (BMICH), Independence Square, Fort area, and Pettah.</p>
